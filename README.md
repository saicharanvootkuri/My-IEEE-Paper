# Efficient Token Transfer Using ERC-20 Decentralized Exchange

**Published in IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Cybersecurity (ISCS), 2024**

## Abstract
The paper presents a practical approach to enhancing user experience in blockchain-based token transfers by developing a decentralized web application (Web3) that adheres to ERC-20 standards. The system empowers users to send tokens effortlessly by connecting to various wallets available in the market. This solution aims to address the challenges of interoperability and user-friendliness in decentralized applications.
